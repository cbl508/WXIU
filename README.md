If the PC does not meet the Windows 11 system requirements you will need to enable the correct registry values. You can pull the values from the script WXIU_bypass or run it before applying WXIU. A reboot is required after performing the registry changes.

I've only tested this with PDQ deploy. It will need admin credetnails so you may need to modify the script. Don't use plaintext passwords in scripts--encyrpt them first in an .xml file. Don't enable win-rm.
This will also perform a cleanup after the install is successful. PDQ may report it was failed but setupact.log shows it's successful. The machine will require a manual reboot despite having code for a reboot. This is because of the /noreboot switch. If you want the computers to restart automatically, remove this switch. There are no prompts to display when the update is finished; you could check setupact.log or look in task manager (details) to see if SetupHost.exe is still running to verify.
